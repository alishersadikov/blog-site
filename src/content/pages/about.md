I am an experienced software developer with a diverse skill set and background that go beyond IT. Why do I like what I do?\
\
- I am a driven and motivated individual with an innate desire to contribute to the well-being of others. Nothing else has made that possible for me to the extent software development has.\
\
- I am fascinated with tech and I derive pleasure from building things with it (the nerd side of me): logic and order, room for creativity, the necessity of constant learning, refactoring, efficiency improvements, etc.\
\
In addition, I make sure I am an effective software developer, not just a coder/programmer, the kind that just turns requirements into code without questioning them. If software people had all the time and all the resources in the world, we could build close to ideal products (or would we?) - technically at least. However, as every real software team has already realized, resources are limited and deadlines are tight.\
\
So while focusing on building scalable and maintainable solutions, I always try to understand the end-goal, see the big picture, evaluate the time characteristics, and make trade-offs based on those factors. Evaluating trade-offs and reflecting them is part of my daily software life.\
\
Finally, I am a reliable, emotionally intelligent, and perceptive team player with a strong work ethic. I take ownership of the features I build and the problems I solve, by maintaining excellent verbal and written communication with my immediate team and the extended stakeholders.
